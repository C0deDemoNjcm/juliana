            <h1>About me</h1>
                My name is Juliana. I am originally from
                Zimbabwe but currently live in South Africa.
                I love kids and that is somewhat the theme of
                this portfolio. I also love helping others and engaging
                in community services as much as possible.

            <h1 class="k">My interests</h1>
            I describe myself as an astrophile because I have this weird 
            interest (obsession) with anything celestial. All I have ever
            dreamt of was buying a telescope with my first pay.
            <h1>Gained skills</h1>
            I have teamwork skills in the sense that I beleive I understand
            people's different background and I'm able to work with them irregardless.
            I have great leadership skills and I belive that I would make a great leader someday.

            <h1 class="c">My school</h1>
            I school at Kitsong Independent School of the RBN. Even though waking up
            early in the morning everday is a burden, school is great. It allows us to get 
            exposed to certain things in life and it also acts as a free trial of adulthood.
