        <h3 >My Saturday</h3>
        <p >
            On Saturday I was supposed to attend one of my school mate's funeral but I wasn't able to. So I was home for the whole day and tried to catch up with my school work and attempt to be a bit ahead. My school days are now really busy so I don't get the chance to process whatever that was being taught during the week so I use my weekends to catch up. After that I just read my novel, ate dinner and then went to sleep.
