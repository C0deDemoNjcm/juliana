        <h3>About myself</h3>
        <p>My name is Juliana Chitsamatanga. I am a person who loves engaging with people. I may seem shy and quite at fisrt but beleive me, when I start to talk I won't finish. I am interested in astronomy but I would never persue a career in that field. Instead I am looking at different sections of engineering. I dislike people who make others feel uncomfortable and excluded in a group as I know how it feels like given the fact that I am not a South African citizen.</p>

            <h4>My academics</h4>
   <p>So I am doing pure maths,physics,EGD and IT. I chose IT and physics because I was interested in them and I obviously had to choose pure maths so that I could do them. I chose EGD because I told myself I had no choice. It was either EGD, Drama(I am a terrible actor) or Geography which I disliked for no reason in particular.</p>
